# Networks and Race

## Racism in America

> - Overt, animus-based racism has declined a lot

## But racial inequality is still dramatic

## There is a lot of research on the causes

> - Overt social, economic, and institutional racism existed until the 1960s
>   - Slavery, Jim Crow, Redlining, GI Bill, etc.
> - This left black Americans with less wealth, worse jobs, worse schools, etc.
> - Our system makes some of these inequalities self-reinforcing
>   - E.g., school funding

## Social Capital is an underappreciated cause

> - Social capital is our ability to access resources through our social networks
> - Social networks are highly segregated, and so even without overt racism, people of color have less access to social capital
> - This can include access to mentors, jobs, etc. but also money to handle unexpected expenses or to invest in a small business
> - We can see other inequalities, but social capital is often invisible

## Networks matter a lot

> - In the 90s, people were given vouchers to move to lower poverty areas
> - Chetty at al. found that children did better as adults the longer they lived in higher income / higher mobility areas
>	- Why? One (the best!) explanation is that people gain greater social capital

## Follow up study in 2022

> - Measured a few markers of social capital
> - Most important predictor of upward mobility was high "economic connectedness" of where you lived
> - Economic connectedness was measured as the proportion of high-income people that low-income people were connected to in the area

## Takeaways

> - Networks provide a hidden inertia to society, reproducing the world as it is
> - Differences in economic capital or cultural capital are more visible
> - Our achievements are partially a function of our undeserved social networks
> - Worth thinking about "network equality"

## Discussion



## Networks and racism

> - How can networks produce or maintain racially biased outcomes?
> - How does this tie into ideas about social/cultural/economic capital?
> - How can we use what we know about networks to reduce racial inequality?
