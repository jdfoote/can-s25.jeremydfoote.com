## Racism in America

> - Overt, animus-based racism has declined a lot

## But there is still lots of racism

> - Some is psychological
>	- Unconscious biases
>	- Homophily
> - Some is "structural" and a result of past racism
>	- Examples in the built environment?
>	- In education?
>	- In hiring?

## Networks and racism

> - How can networks produce or maintain racially biased outcomes?
> - How does this tie into ideas about social/cultural/economic capital?
> - How can we use what we know about networks to reduce racial inequality?


## Networks matter a lot

> - In the 90s, people were given vouchers to move to lower poverty areas
> - Chetty at al. found that children did better as adults the longer they lived in higher income / higher mobility areas
>	- Why? One (the best!) explanation is that people gain greater social capital

## Follow up study in 2022

> - Measured a few markers of social capital
> - Most important predictor of upward mobility was high "economic connectedness" of where you lived
> - Economic connectedness was measured as the proportion of high-income people that low-income people were connected to in the area

## Follow up study in 2022

## Takeaways

> - Networks provide a hidden inertia to society, reproducing the world as it is
> - Differences in economic capital or cultural capital are more visible
> - Our achievements are partially a function of our undeserved social networks
> - Worth thinking about "network equality"
