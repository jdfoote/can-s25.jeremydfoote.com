title: Project Idea
---

Some of the projects require ongoing work during the semester, such as doing a network-based intervention or gathering network data.

To help you to be well-prepared for the final project, you should start thinking about your project idea early. For this assignment, you will submit a brief (~1 page) description of your project idea. This should include the following:

- Which project option you are planning to do
- A brief description of the data you will use
- A brief description of the network concepts you will use
